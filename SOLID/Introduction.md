SOLID:

S: Single Responsbility - A class should have single reason to change or single responsibity.

O: Open / Closed - Open to extension & Closed to modification,

L: Liskov Substituion - Use SubClass instead of its parent class.

I: Interface segregation - A class should not depends on methods that it does not need to implement.

D: Dependecy Inversion - Your classes & modules should depends on abstractions instead of concrete implementation.
